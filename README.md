# Citi Bike Usage in JC

* Jersey City’s bike share system, Citi Bike is the largest system in the USA and an essential part of the city’s transportation network.

* Citi Bike consists of 20,000 bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city and 1,300 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Jersey City.

* The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips.

* People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements, and more.

### How its used?
* Citi Bike is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year. Customers either become an Annual Member or buy a short-term pass through the Citi Bike app. Then it is possible to find an available bike nearby, and get a ride code or use your member key to unlock it. There is no limit for taking any rides once your pass or membership is active. The customer can return the rented bike to any station, and wait for the green light on the dock to make sure it’s locked.
